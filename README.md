# Information Visualization 

## Getting Started
First, build the static output files:
```bash
npm run build
```

Access the **_/out_** directory and run:
```bash
python -m http.server
```
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the visualizations.

To avoid having to compile at every change just do:
```bash
npm run dev
```
